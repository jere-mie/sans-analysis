# F Matrix Calculation

## Dimensions

The dimensions of the matrix (i, k, l) are of size (Q, R, L)  
It is useful to think of the F matrix as "L" 2-d matrices of size QxR. This is how matrix multiplication is carried out.

## Matrix Element Calculations

Matrix elements are calculated by the below formula.  
Note that "$j_l$" refers to the Legendre polynomial of degree l (from L).

## F0

Sometimes, we refer to F0. This is the part of the F matrix where l=0 in the above matrix element calculation. The matrix is of size QxR.
